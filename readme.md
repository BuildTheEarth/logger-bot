## Bot

This bot is used for logging messages on the main discord server. Its goal is to be extremely simple and reliable

## BuildTheEarth

Our mission is to fully recreate the entire Earth in Minecraft at a 1:1 scale. One block in Minecraft equates to roughly one meter in the real world, meaning that this project will fully recreate the size of our planet. Anyone is able to join us and contribute to the largest and most expansive build project to ever have been attempted in Minecraft. Every language, nationality, and regional difference is accepted and regarded as our greatest attribute as we continue our journey to unite all of Humanity's greatest achievements into a single Minecraft world.
Join us in this massive project as we recreate the Earth in Minecraft, in 1:1 scale, one block at a time. [**Discord Server**][invite]
